    "## Question 1\n",
    ">On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. \n",

    "I'm interested in where that AOV of 3145.13 came from. I'm guessing it is probably from the mean as high values of order amounts will drag this number up. Using panda's handy `describe()` method on the data frame, we can see that the mean order amount is indeed 3,145.13. Also, there is an incredibly large standard deviation of 41282.54. This means that on average, the values vary 41,282.54 from the mean, making the mean not a very useful representation of the AOV!\n",

    "The `describe()` function we used also gave us some valuable information to better understand this data aside from the mean and standard deviation.  We can see the minimum value is 90 and max value is 704,000. We can also see the values for the median and first and third quartile. Comparing these numbers, we can see that the maximum value is much higher than the other values. Considering our dataset has 5000 records, there are probably a few outlier values that are incredibly high dragging up the mean.\n",
